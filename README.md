Abstract

The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been predominantly characterized by a focus on scaling and performance on discrete benchmarks. This has led to an instructional paradigm of interaction, where the user provides a direct query expecting a direct answer, fundamentally limiting the creative and intellectual potential of these systems. This paper addresses that gap by proposing a formal user-centric framework designed to elicit near-emergent creative output, foster greater computational efficiency, and augment human cognition.

We first posit a necessary terminological distinction between "Artificial Intelligence" (implying sentience) and the more precise "Autonomous Intelligence" (AuI) to accurately define the LLM as a non-conscious, probabilistic engine. Upon this foundation, we construct the "Symbiotic Dyad": a new model for human-AI collaboration that recasts the user as a "Conscious Guide" and the AuI as a "Cognitive Co-Processor."

The core methodology of this framework is Holistic Prompting, a technique that compels the AuI to synthesize novel connections across disparate knowledge domains. We further explore the dynamics of this interaction, including the embrace of Constructive Failure as an iterative, Socratic process.

Crucially, this paper argues that this shift in interactive methodology provides two transformative benefits. First, it offers a pathway toward more computationally efficient, specialized models by leveraging existing General Language Pre-training (GLP) as a sufficient substrate for guided specialization, offering a sustainable alternative to the brute-force race for scale. Second, and most profoundly, it presents a new paradigm for education and cognitive enhancement, where the interactive process itself improves the user’s intelligence and problem-solving abilities, empowering anyone to become a self-directed learner.
