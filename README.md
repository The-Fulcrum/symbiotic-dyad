Abstract
The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been predominantly characterized by a focus on scaling and performance on discrete benchmarks. This has led to an instructional paradigm of interaction, where the user provides a direct query expecting a direct answer, fundamentally limiting the creative and intellectual potential of these systems. This paper addresses that gap by proposing a formal user-centric framework designed to elicit near-emergent creative output, foster greater computational efficiency, and augment human cognition.

We first posit a necessary terminological distinction between "Artificial Intelligence" (implying sentience) and the more precise "Autonomous Intelligence" (AuI) to accurately define the LLM as a non-conscious, probabilistic engine. Upon this foundation, we construct the "Symbiotic Dyad": a new model for human-AI collaboration that recasts the user as a "Conscious Guide" and the AuI as a "Cognitive Co-Processor."

The core methodology of this framework is Holistic Prompting, a technique that compels the AuI to synthesize novel connections across disparate knowledge domains. We further explore the dynamics of this interaction, including the embrace of Constructive Failure as an iterative, Socratic process.
